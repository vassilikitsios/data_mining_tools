Python data mining tools:

1) Pandas is used for general data wrangling.

2) Data can be read in directly from a text file into the pandas data frame, or via an SQL database.

3) General machine learning tasks are performed using scikit-learn.

4) Classification applications using neural networks and logistic regression are also implemented using Theano.

# data_mining_tools

Python data mining tools:
Pandas is used for general data wrangling.
Data can be read in directly from a text file into the pandas data frame, or via an SQL database.
General machine learning tasks are performed using scikit-learn.
Classification applications using neural networks and logistic regression are also implemented using Theano.
